/**
 * @file postMetricsService.js
 * @description
 * This file is the powerhouse for calculating and updating a post's various
 * relevance and popularity metrics within the database. It's designed to be
 * triggered whenever a significant engagement event occurs on a post (e.g.,
 * a view, like, comment, or share).
 *
 * The `updatePostMetricsDB` function takes raw engagement signals and
 * transforms them into sophisticated scores that drive the recommendation
 * and trending algorithms. It handles:
 *
 * 1.  **Engagement Weighting:** Applying predefined weights to different event types
 * (like, comment, share, view, completion) to get a total engagement `weight`
 * for the current interaction.
 *
 * 2.  **Sliding Window Events:** Maintaining a short-term history of recent
 * engagement events in the `windowEvents` array, which is crucial for
 * detecting "rising" content. Older events outside the `RISING_WINDOW_MS`
 * are pruned.
 *
 * 3.  **Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs):** Calculating both `shortTermVelocityEMA`
 * and `historicalVelocityEMA`. These EMAs track the "speed" of engagement
 * over different timeframes, using half-life decay to give more weight to
 * recent activity.
 *
 * 4.  **Trending Score Calculation:** Deriving a `trendingScore` by combining
 * the velocity ratio of short-term vs. long-term EMAs (identifying bursts
 * of popularity) with a "burst score" that rewards posts with high recent activity.
 *
 * 5.  **"Is Rising" Status:** Determining if a post should be flagged as `isRising`
 * by comparing its recent activity rate (from `windowEvents`) against its
 * long-term baseline.
 *
 * 6.  **Bayesian Score Calculation:** This is a sophisticated step that "smooths"
 * a post's average engagement using global category statistics and creator-specific
 * averages as a "prior." This helps in two main ways:
 * * **Cold Start Problem:** New posts with few interactions get a more
 * reasonable initial score instead of wildly fluctuating.
 * * **Stability:** It makes scores more robust by incorporating broader
 * context, preventing a single viral moment from disproportionately
 * inflating a score. The prior decays over time, allowing the post's
 * actual performance to eventually dominate.
 *
 * 7.  **Time Decay on Bayesian Score:** The Bayesian score is further decayed
 * based on the post's age, ensuring older content (even if historically
 * good) doesn't endlessly outrank fresh content.
 *
 * 8.  **Database Persistence:** Finally, all calculated metrics are saved back
 * to the `Post` document in MongoDB.
 *
 * This function is designed to be idempotent and can be called repeatedly
 * with new events, ensuring post metrics are always up-to-date and reflect
 * the latest user interactions, contributing to a dynamic and relevant content feed.
 *
 * @param {string} postId - The ID of the post to update.
 * @param {string[]} eventTypes - An array of event types (e.g., ['view', 'like'])
 * that just occurred on the post.
 * @param {number} nowMs - The current timestamp in milliseconds, used for consistent
 * time calculations (defaults to Date.now()).
 * @returns {object} An object containing the updated trendingScore, isRising status,
 * and bayesianScore.
